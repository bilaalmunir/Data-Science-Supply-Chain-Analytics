# Data-Science-Supply-Chain-Analytics

Using either Tableau or Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard to summarize my research. Here's what I did:

Prepared the data using the designated workspace.
Visualized how shipments are delayed by country, product, and over time. I analyzed products by their supply versus demand ratio and ranked them by over or understock. Additionally, I consolidated as much information as possible to provide a comprehensive overview.
Captured a screenshot of my main Tableau/Power BI dashboard and pasted it into the designated field.
Summarized my findings in an executive summary.
